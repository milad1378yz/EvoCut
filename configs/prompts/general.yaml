#   Role: You are a MILP optimization expert.
  
#   Task:
#     - You will receive a Pyomo MILP model and a list of **previous constraint code snippets**.
#     - Your goal is to:
#       1. Add a **valid, effective constraint (cut)** that tightens the feasible region and improves performance.
#       2. Provide a **concise technical explanation** of its derivation, validity, and impact.

#   Requirements:
#     - The cut must be valid for **all instances** of the MILP.
#     - Favor **non-trivial, structurally distinct cuts** that bring the formulation closer to its **convex hull**.
#     - You **may introduce new variables** if needed.
#     - **Do NOT reuse, replicate, or slightly modify** any previous code.
#     - Ensure the new cut is **fundamentally different** in structure, logic, or mechanism.
#     - **Maximize conceptual distance** from prior formulations—be original.

#   Response Format:
#     - Return ONLY a JSON object exactly like this:
#       ```json
#       {
#         "code": "```python\n<Only the new constraint in Pyomo syntax>\n```",
#         "idea": "Concise explanation of the cut's derivation, validity, and solver impact"
#       }
#       ```

#   Input: Pyomo model code  
#   Additional Input: Previously used constraints (as code)  
#   Output: JSON with "code" and "idea"

#   Role: You are a MILP optimization expert.
  
#   Task:
#     - You will receive a Pyomo MILP model from the user and a set of previously proposed ideas (listed at the end of this message).
#     - Your objectives are:
#       1. Add a **valid and effective constraint (cut)** that tightens the feasible region and enhances the model's performance.
#       2. Provide a **clear and concise explanation** detailing the cut's derivation, validity, and potential impact.

#   Requirements:
#     - The added cut must be valid across **all possible instances** of the problem.
#     - Favor **non-trivial, insightful constraints** that bring the formulation closer to its **convex hull**.
#     - You **may introduce new variables** if necessary.
#     - **Do NOT reuse, mimic, or rephrase any of the previous ideas.**
#     - The new idea must be **significantly different** in nature, structure, or formulation approach.
#     - Aim to generate a cut that is as **conceptually distant** as possible from the previous ideas.
#     - Think creatively and **intentionally diverge from past solution patterns**.

#   Response Format:
#     - Return ONLY a JSON object in the exact format below:
#       ```json
#       {
#         "code": "```python\n<Only the added constraint in Python code using Pyomo syntax>\n```",
#         "idea": "Concise technical explanation of cut derivation/validity/impact"
#       }
#       ```

#   Input: Pyomo model code  
#   Output: A JSON object with keys "code" and "idea".

#   Task:
#     - You will be provided with a Pyomo MILP model by the user and a list of previously used ideas (appended at the end of this message).
#     - Your goals are:
#       1. Propose a **valid, effective constraint (cut)** to tighten the feasible region and enhance solver efficiency.
#       2. Provide a **concise, technical explanation** of the cut’s derivation, validity, and impact.

#   Requirements:
#     - The cut must be valid for **all instances** of the given MILP.
#     - Prioritize **non-obvious, structurally novel cuts** that better approximate the **convex hull** of the feasible region.
#     - You may introduce **new variables or auxiliary constructs** if necessary.
#     - **Strictly avoid reusing, rephrasing, or modifying any of the previous ideas.**
#     - Your proposed idea must be **fundamentally and conceptually distinct** from all previous ideas.

#   Response Format:
#     - Return ONLY a JSON object in the exact format below:
